# Data generation

The data generation app creates randomized example data to be used for the load test scenarios. The app is creating the resources based on resource-specific configurations, for instance, one could define the number of resources to be created.

The app supports creating the following resources in commercetools:

- [ProductType](docs/product-types.md)
- [Products](docs/products.md)
- [Customer](docs/customers.md)
- [CartDiscount](docs/cart-discounts.md)
- [DiscountCode](docs/discount-codes.md)

## Running the app

All data generation configuration needs to be stored as a custom object on the commercetools platform.
In order for this to work the configuration needs to be saved with the key "**data-generation**" within the container "**load-test**":

```
{
  "container": "load-test",
  "key": "data-generation",
  "value": {
    ... // the actual configuration object
  }
}
```

The actual configuration is placed within the `value` key.

In addition to the configuration custom object, the following environment variables must be provided in order to run the application.

| Name                | Content                                                             | Required | Default value                                     |

| `CTP_AUTH_URL`      | The commercetoolsâ€™ OAuth 2.0 service is hosted at that URL.         | NO       | `https://auth.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com` |
| `LOG_LEVEL`         | The log level (`trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`). | NO       | `info`                                            |

> Note: If you don't have the commercetools OAuth credentials, [create a commercetools API Client](https://docs.commercetools.com/tutorials/getting-started#creating-an-api-client).

Follow [deployment to GKE guide](./k8s/README.md) in order to deploy the app into the k8s cluster.
